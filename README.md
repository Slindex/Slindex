Hello! My name is David. I'm a **passionate** professional practitioner in the data world.

I'm a simple, calm, analytical and strategic person. I love to be **curious** about every topic related to data and technology.

I strongly hold on the following 6 **values** as my pillars to perform in any personal or professional relationship:

* Respect
* Honesty
* Solidarity
* Humility
* Kindness
* Goodness

I strive every day to give back and **compensate** society and the environment for everything they have given to me.

Finally, when I'm involved in the development of professional initiatives aligned with my **convictions** and **principles**, I stand out remarkably.
